            <li><span class="bold">OCTOBER, 2004</span> - La Liga debut
                <p class="regular">At just 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, Lionel Messi makes his official league debut for Barcelona, coming on as a substitute late in the game. against Espanyol. At the time, he becomes the youngest player to represent the club in an official game after joining the club’s famed La Masia academy in 2000, moving f rom Argentine club Newell’s Old Boys as a 13-year-old.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">AUGUST, 2005</span> - International debut
                <p class="regular">Messi makes his debut for Argentina in a friendly against Hungary at the age of 18, coming on in the 63rd minute but receives a red card and is sent off just two minutes later for a perceived elbow against defender Vilmos Vanczak.   </p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">DECEMBER, 2005</span>- Golden Boy
                <p class="regular">There’s no doubt Barcelona has something special on its hands and the world is starting to take notice as well when he’s named the Golden Boy -- the award for the best young player in Europe</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">MARCH, 2006</span> - First international goal
                <p class="regular">After a rocky start to his international career, Messi scores his first goal for Argentina with a signature run and curled left-foot effort in a friendly defeat to Croatia.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">JUNE, 2006</span> - World Cup debut
                <p class="regular">Coming on in the 74th minute against Serbia and Montenegro, Messi becomes the youngest-ever player to represent Argentina at the World Cup.

            <li><span class="bold">MARCH, 2007</span> - First club hat-trick
                <p class="regular">
                 Messi is gaining a reputation for being one of the hottest teenagers in world football by now and his three goals against Real Madrid in 2007 turned him into a household name. It’s his first hat-trick for the club and certainly not his last.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold">APRIL, 2007</span> - His greatest goal?
                <p class="regular">Few goals in the history of football can compare to this one. Messi slaloms his way past multiple Getafe defenders to score perhaps the greatest goal of his career. It strangely mirrors a goal scored by compatriot Diego Maradona against England in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico.</p>
            </li>

                <p class="regular">
                Messi had already won the Champions League in 2006 when making his way into the first team but he is the star man in 2009. He finishes the campaign as the tournament's top scorer and nets in the final against Manchester United in a 2-0 win at Rome’s Olympic Stadium. He’s won a career total of four European titles to date</p>
            </li>
